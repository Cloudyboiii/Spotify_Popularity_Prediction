### Process Breakdown:

1. **User Input**: 
   - Song audio features input through interactive sliders
   - Features include Energy, Danceability, Loudness, etc.

2. **Data Processing & Feature Engineering**:
   - Normalize and scale input features
   - Create engineered features (feature interactions)
   - Prepare data for model input

3. **ML Models**:
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - XGBoost Regressor
   - Both models trained on Spotify dataset

4. **Analysis & Results**:
   - Ensemble predictions from both models
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Optimization recommendations

5. **Output**:
   - Popularity score prediction
   - Interactive visualizations
   - Actionable recommendations
